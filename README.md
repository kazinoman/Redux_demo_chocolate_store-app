If someone intereste this application, firstly clone this repo,
    then, run npm install command
    then, run node index.js comman

This is a redux demo app with no 3rd party redux library app.
 
 In this little application we are keep track the transection and buy/sell process using redux.
 
If any one buy some chocolate then increase our cashCounter amount and decrease centralStorage chocolate amount. 

and If someone return the Chocolate which he buy before then our cash counter position is decrease and central storage of chocolate is increase.

So, this is the main process of this application.
